Good day!

I'm Lauro Atienza from the Phillipines. I am currently working with an international reserach center for rice and is currently taking up online course about web development on Refocus company.

My hobbies include movie marathon on different channels such as netflix, Disney, and Prime video. I also love collecting stamps and miniature toy cars.

My goals for this year were to continue pursuing web development course with Refocus and apply what I learn on my current projects at my official work.

I want to be a web developer to create or develop my own app which I hope will help users from the agricultural sectors. Apps that will help farmers and extension workers with their farming works.

Cheers!
